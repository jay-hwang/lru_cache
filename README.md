### LRU Cache

This is my LRU Cache. It comes with tests written in RSpec.

The LRU Cache is made up of a Hash Map and a Linked List, so I created my own rendition of a Hash Map and a Linked List as well. The hash map needs a hashing function to hash different types into a deterministic hash, so I also created the necessary hashing functions to hash different data types.
